        ### About üöÄ Performance Reports

        This template is for reporting performance-related issues such as low efficiency, abnormal memory usage, lag, or slow loading.

        If your issue is a functional bug, please use the [üêõ Bug Report](https://github.com/ArcesTeam/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=11_Bug_Report.yaml) template. For architecture optimization or new suggestions, use the [üîß Enhancement Report](https://github.com/ArcesTeam/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=14_Enhancement_Report.yaml) or [‚ú® Feature Report](https://github.com/ArcesTeam/{{project-name}}/issues/new?template=15_Feature_Report.yaml).

        Before reporting, please ensure you are using the latest version of the project and try to disable unrelated third-party plugins or mods to rule out external interference.

        > For specific optimization suggestions, feel free to submit a PR or discuss further in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ArcesTeam/discussions).
        >
        > For privacy or security risks, please refer to [SECURITY](https://github.com/ArcesTeam/{{project-name}}/blob/main/.github/lang/en-US/SECURITY.md).
